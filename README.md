LaserWeb4 - Raspberry Pi
========================

This project is for those looking to set up their Raspberry Pi as a LaserWeb4 server in a full or even headless enviroment.

I have included easy to follow scripts for initilizing the Pi's hardware properly so that `/dev/ttyAMA0` is a using the internal UART for reliable communications.

Most of the install scripts where originally from [Protoneer's Pi CNC Hat][1]

Usage
------
````bash
# git checkout https://github.com/iceblu3710/lw.raspberry-pi.git
# cd lw.raspberry-pi
# sudo ./initial_setup.sh
# system_setup.sh
````
